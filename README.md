# TOS Watchdog Chrome Extension

**TOS Watchdog** is a Chrome extension designed to empower users by providing real-time analysis and classification of sentences in online Terms of Service (TOS) agreements. We understand that users often find TOS documents lengthy and filled with complex legal jargon. Our goal is to help users identify potential unfair terms quickly and easily.

# Features
- **Sentence Classification**: TOS Watchdog uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze each sentence in a TOS document and classify it into different categories:

  - **User-Friendly**: Sentences that are fair and user-friendly.
  - **Potentially Unfair**: Sentences that might raise concerns or be disadvantageous to users.
    
- **Real-Time Analysis**: TOS Watchdog performs this analysis in real-time, so you can see how each sentence is categorized as you read through a TOS document.

- **Color-Coded Highlights**: Sentences are color-coded to provide a quick visual indication of their classification, making it easy to identify potentially unfair terms.

# Project Impact:
At TOS Watchdog, we are committed to making the online world a fairer and more transparent place for all users. Our Chrome extension has the potential to make a significant impact in several key areas:
1. **Empowering Users**: TOS agreements are often lengthy and filled with legal jargon, making it challenging for users to understand their rights and obligations. TOS Watchdog empowers users by providing real-time analysis and classification of sentences, helping them quickly identify potentially unfair terms. This enhanced understanding allows users to make more informed decisions about the services they use.

2. **Transparency and Accountability**: By highlighting and classifying sentences in TOS agreements, FairTOS promotes transparency in online interactions. Users can see which terms may be disadvantageous or legally complex, encouraging companies to adopt fairer and more user-friendly policies.

3. **Privacy and Data Protection**: With the growing concerns surrounding data privacy and user rights, FairTOS aids users in identifying terms that may impact their personal information and privacy. This knowledge can help users safeguard their data and privacy more effectively.

4. **Legal Literacy**: FairTOS is a valuable tool for improving legal literacy. Users can become more familiar with common legal terms and clauses found in TOS agreements, contributing to a more informed online community.

5. **User-Driven Improvement**: We encourage user feedback and contributions to improve FairTOS. The community's involvement in reporting misclassifications and suggesting enhancements is vital in refining our sentence classification models and ensuring that the extension remains accurate and effective.

6. **Raising Awareness**: By promoting the fair treatment of users through our extension, we aim to raise awareness of the importance of fair and ethical business practices in the online world.

In a digital landscape where user rights and online fairness are paramount, TOS Watchdog is a step towards a more equitable online experience for all. We believe that this project can contribute to a more informed, empowered, and fair online community.
